#  Discussion of the business problem
Parsippany is a town located in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. It is a heart for working class-people from New Jersey and its neighboring states, New York, and Pennsylvania. There are 100s of restaurants in the town that feeds 1000s of those working-class people quick and healthy breakfast-lunch and even dinner. Today I am going to explore the restaurants which is within 4 miles of center of the town which typically serves breakfast and lunch. New Jersey is also home of "Diners" which are classical American restaurants who serves delicious breakfast-lunch-dinner in a pleasant environment (some of them are open for 24 hours operation).

The main purposes of this project are:

To explore the best place for lunch within 4 miles of the search-point location and find out what categories of restaurants are available.

To predict the best location to open a new restaurant within that radius which can be easily accessible from the heart of the town where there are majority of offices and companies.

#  Audience who would be interested in this project
This project is targeted to the following group of people:

This project could catch the attention from working-class people who is not local to the town and yet is seeking for the best place to grab breakfast and lunch.

This project could also benefit the people who have newly moved to live in the town and have no idea on where to go to enjoy the delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Small entrepreneurs who are willing to open a new restaurant in the town could also be benefitted from this project because I am going to predict the best spot to start a new food business within the covered radius.

# Data Sources
The data for analysis will be extracted from Foursquare App using Foursquare API to explore restaurants and diners within 4 miles of the core location which is 199 Smith Rd, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ which is the address for Sheraton Hotel in Parsippany, NJ.

I will looking for midpoint area of venues to locate the best spot to open a new restaurant.Before that our major focus will be on to explore the restaurants which provides breakfast-lunch and are located within 4 miles of the Sheraton Hotel. I will also find what category of restaurants are located within the covered radius.
